# Silhouette extract

This repo contains a simple package that simplifies the access to the 
silhouette files, as well as a script to calculate, for each contour,
the sum of all the pixel values of each channel using the source TIFF
file.

This package is provided as-is. Clone it and adapt it to your needs!

## Instalation

A python environment is recommended (conda could work as well). In it,
install the requirements and this package:

    # pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ pip install https://github.com/amarallab/silhouette-extract
